# Database design 
# We have created sample data for a coffee shop chain with three locations in Omaha, NE. 
The owner want to identify factors that contribute to their success, and ultimately to make data-informed decisions.
They uploaded their data in a series of spreadsheets and created a data module. From that data, they designed an operations dashboard and a marketing dashboard. 

- Coffee operations: This sample dashboard demonstrates operational data from a coffee chain. Location: Team content > Samples > Dashboards. 
- Coffee marketing: This sample dashboard demonstrates marketing data from a coffee chain. Location: Team content > Samples > Dashboards.
- Coffee sales and marketing: This sample data module contains representative retail data from a coffee chain. Location: Team content > Samples > Data.
- April Sales.zip: This sample data contains representative retail data from a coffee chain. This ZIP file contains nine related CSV files. Location: Team content > Samples > Data > Source files > Retail.
